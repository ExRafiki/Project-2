<span style="color:red">##GA PROJECT NUMBER 2:</span>

###Goal:

The goal was to make a ''full stack'' website that can use data as well as associate to certain users.The interest in making a TV shows theme website is based on my passion for all kinds of tv shows.Giving the ability to not only add or delete tv shows as well as comment was a key feature and was part of my MVP.Extras such as user settings as well as favorites were added features that i believe gave the site a little more depth.

###Languages used:
* HTML5
* SCSS
* JavaScript with EJS

* CSS Framework : Materialize

* Others : MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js
* Version Control : Git, Github.

###Released on

* Github

##Process

###Research

I started by looking at all tv show catalogs as well as streaming platforms and trying to see the information they were displaying the format/ styling as well as the manner in which the image the displayed.
Making sure that only relevant information was displayed once and not through the entire user experience.

###Development

* 1 - Visualizing how the data had to be formatted to be properly displayed on the page and provide with the user with the relevant data.
* 2 - Working step by step from back end to front end not forget to keep my naming convention schematically correct.
* 3 - Some time was spent on the user data as it was the hardest to display on the page , password had to be avoided because of the hashing of the password.

###Lessons learned:

*  Linking the back end with the front end of an application
*  What are the rules aswell as standard to using Node.js

###Challenges

*  Displaying the data properly
*  Getting the user data to be shown only in certain cases as well as restricting access to certain routes.
*  Time management , did not spend enough time designing the look and feel of the application.

###Goals achieved

- [X] Functional application
- [X] Clean code and happy with data structure
- [X] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] <span style="color:red">Well design application</span>

###Future Features
